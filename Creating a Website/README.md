<h1 align=center> Creating a React-based Website </h1>
<!-- <p align=center> npx create-react </p> -->

### Generating the Website:
- While there are multiple ways to generate a React project, the easiest way is using a node.js command which does all of the work for you
- To begin, in your IDE terminal, run the following command: <code>npx create-react-app src</code>
- This command creates a new React project in a subfolder of your current directory (named 'src')

## Uploading to Github
- An important point to note is that using the command above will generate a "node_modules" folder in your source code folder, which contains basic background react files needed for development.
- You'll notice this folder is very large, too large to upload to GitHub, and as a result should be excluded in your repository. 
- To do this, add the following to the '.gitignore' file in the 'src' folder: <code>./node_modules</code>

## Organization
- This repository is split into segments of the development process. Each segment contains a README (like this one) to help guide you through that segment
- The first steps are contained in the "Creating a Website" folder. After completing those steps, you can host your creation using the steps in the "Host your Website" folder.  -->
